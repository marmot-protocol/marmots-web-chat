# Marmots Web Chat

A reference implementation of the [marmot-ts](https://github.com/hzrd149/marmot-ts) library - a TypeScript library for building MLS (Messaging Layer Security) group chat applications on Nostr.

This chat application demonstrates how to integrate marmot-ts with a modern React + TypeScript stack to build secure, end-to-end encrypted group messaging functionality.

## Technology Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite for fast development and builds
- Applesauce libraries for Nostr integration
- marmot-ts for MLS group chat
- Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui components
- RxJS for reactive state management

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install   # Install dependencies and build marmot-ts
pnpm dev       # Start development server
pnpm build     # Build for production
pnpm preview   # Preview production build
pnpm format    # Format code with Prettier
```
